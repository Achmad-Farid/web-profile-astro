Aora is a dynamic mobile application designed for users to discover, share, and stream videos effortlessly. This project was developed to enhance my skills in React Native, allowing me to create a seamless cross-platform experience for both Android and iOS users.

The application features an intuitive user interface that prioritizes user engagement and content discovery. Key functionalities include:

Trending Content: Users can easily access a section dedicated to trending videos, keeping them updated with the latest popular content.
Profile Creation and Interaction: Users can create personalized profiles, follow friends, and interact through comments and shares, fostering a vibrant video community.
Simple Navigation: The appâ€™s layout is designed for easy navigation, allowing users to quickly find their favorite videos or explore new content categories.
This project not only allowed me to practice my React Native skills but also deepened my understanding of mobile app development, user experience design, and API integration.
