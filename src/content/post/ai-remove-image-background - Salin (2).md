Shoes World is a comprehensive web platform designed to showcase and sell a variety of local footwear. The project was developed as part of my graduation requirements for MSIB Batch 5 Skilvul #Tech4Impact: Full-Stack Web Development, in collaboration with two other talented team members.

The website features a user-friendly interface that allows customers to easily browse through an extensive selection of shoes, including detailed product descriptions, high-quality images, and customer reviews to enhance the shopping experience. Users can filter products based on categories, sizes, and styles, making it simple to find the perfect pair.

Key functionalities of the site include:

Responsive Design: The website is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a seamless shopping experience across all platforms.
Secure Payment Integration: Customers can make secure transactions through multiple payment methods, providing peace of mind while shopping.
Local Craftsmanship Promotion: Shoes World emphasizes local craftsmanship by featuring a diverse range of locally-made footwear, supporting local artisans and businesses.
This project not only showcases my skills in full-stack web development but also highlights the importance of supporting local industries.
