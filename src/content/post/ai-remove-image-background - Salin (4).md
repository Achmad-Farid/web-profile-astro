Digi UMKM is a comprehensive web platform developed to provide valuable information about webinars aimed at empowering small and medium enterprises (UMKM). This project was created as part of my graduation requirements for the MSIB IBM Skillsbuild for AI & Cybersecurity program and represents one of the most challenging projects I have undertaken.

The website not only serves as a resource for accessing upcoming webinars but also incorporates advanced security measures to ensure user data protection. Key features of Digi UMKM include:

Email Verification and Data Sanitization: Implementing robust security protocols, such as email verification and input sanitization, was crucial to safeguard user information and prevent malicious attacks. This aspect of the project significantly enhanced my understanding of web security principles.
AI Sentiment Analysis: The platform also integrates AI-driven sentiment analysis for comments made during webinars. This feature allows organizers to gauge participant feedback and engagement effectively, helping to improve future sessions based on user sentiment.
User-Friendly Interface: Designed with the user in mind, Digi UMKM offers an intuitive interface for easy navigation, making it simple for users to find and register for webinars.
Despite the project's completion, I regret to share that the website is currently inaccessible due to the expiration of my IBM trial account, which limited ongoing access to the development environment. Nonetheless, this project has significantly enriched my skills in web development, cybersecurity, and artificial intelligence, preparing me for future challenges in the tech industry.
